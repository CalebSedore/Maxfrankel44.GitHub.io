<h2>Greatest Living American (G.L.A)</h2>
  
<p2>Tom Brady a childhood hero of mine graduated my favorite college of all time, the University of Michigan, where he was a stellar quarterback. After being drafted late in the NFL draft Brady grew into a professional football legend, and solidified himself as not only the greatest quarterback of all time, but the greatest football player of all time. </p2>
